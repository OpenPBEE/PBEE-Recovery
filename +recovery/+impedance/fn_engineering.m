%
% Parameters
% ----------
% num_reals: int
%   number of Monte Carlo simulations assessed
% repair_cost_ratio: array [num_reals x 1]
%   simulated building repair cost; normalized by building replacemnt
%   value.
% building_value: number
%   replacment value of building, in USD, non including land
% surge_factor: number
%   amplification factor for impedance time based on a post disaster surge
%   in demand for skilled trades and construction supplies
% redesign_trigger: logical array [num_reals x num_sys]
%   is redesign required for the given system
% is_engineer_on_retainer: logical
%   is there a pre-arranged agreement with an engineer for priorization of
%   redesign
% user_options: struct
%   contains paramters of system design time function, set by user
% design_min: number
%   lower bound on the median design time
% design_max: number
%   upper bound on the median design time
% trunc_pd: matlab normal distribution object
%   standard normal distrubtion, truncated at upper and lower bounds
% beta: number
%   lognormal standard deviation (dispersion)
% impeding_factor_medians: table
%   median delays for various impeding factors
%
% Returns
% -------
% eng_mob_imped: array [num_reals x num_sys]
%   Simulated enginering mobilization time for each system
% eng_design_imped: array [num_reals x num_sys]
%   Simulated enginering design time for each system

% Notes
% ------
% assumes engineering mobilization and re-design time are independant, but
% are correlated between each system. In other words, you will have the same 
% designers for the structural, stairs, exterior, and whatever other systems 
% need design time, but the time it takes to spin up an engineer is not
% related to the time it takes for them to complete the re-design.
